> Despite a remarkable continuity in medical ethics across millennia, the widely
> revered Hippocratic tradition could not adequately address modern health
> concerns such as informed consent, privacy, access to health care, communal
> and public health responsibilities, and research involving human subjects.
> Professional ethics was also ill equipped to provide an adequate framework for
> public policy in a pluralistic society.

> _Ethics_ is a generic term covering several different ways of examining and
> interpreting the moral life.

> _General normative ethics_ addresses the question, "Which general moral norms
> should we use to guide and evaluate conduct, and why?" Ethical theories seek
> to identify and justify these norms, which are often referred to as
> principles, rules, rights, or virtues.

> The term _practical ethics_, as used here, is synonymous with _applied ethics_
> and stands in contrast to _theoretical ethics_. _Practical ethics_ refers to
> the use of moral concepts and norms in deliberations about moral problems,
> practices, and policies in professions, institutions, and public policy.

> Two types of nonnormative ethics are distinguishable. The first is
> _descriptive ethics_, which is the factual investigation of moral beliefs and
> conduct. It often uses scientific techniques to study how people reason and
> act.

> The second type of nonnormative ethics is _metaethics_, which involves
> analysis of the language, concepts, and methods of reasoning in normative
> ethics.

> Descriptive ethics and metaethics are nonnormative because their objective is
> to establish what factually or conceptually _is_ the case, not what ethically
> _ought to be_ the case or what is ethically _valuable_.

> In its most familiar sense, the word _morality_... refers to norms about right
> and wrong human conduct that are widely shared and form a stable societal
> compact. As a social institution, morality encompasses many standards of
> conduct, including moral principles, rules, ideals, rights, and virtues.

> Some core tenets found in every acceptable particular morality are not
> relative to cultures, groups, or individuals.

> The literature of biomedical ethics virtually never debates the merit or
> acceptability of these central moral norms. Debates do occur, however, about
> their precise meaning, scope, weight, and strength, of in regard to hard moral
> cases or current practices that merit careful scrutiny...

> We call the set of universal norms shared by all persons committed to the
> morality _the common morality_.

> Philosophers debate whether one of these regions of the moral
> life---obligations, rights, or virtues---is more basic or more valuable than
> another, but in the common morality there is no reason to give primacy to any
> one area or type of norm...An undue emphasis on any one of these areas or
> types of norms disregards the full scope of morality.
-   This may be descriptively true of how common morality is conceived of, but is
-   not useful if the conception of common morality is flawed or contradictory
-   especially in regard to conflicts between these features.
   
> ...we offer now only three clarifications of our position: First, the common

> medical or other profession. Both are learned and transmitted in communities.
> The primary difference is that the common morality has authority in all
> communities, whereas particular moralities are authoritative only for specific
> groups. Second, we accept moral pluralism in _particular_ moralities... but we
> reject moral pluralism, understood as relativism, in the _common_ morality.
> No particular moral way of life qualifies as morally acceptable unless it
> conforms to the standards in the common morality. Third, the common morality
> comprises moral _beliefs_ that all morally committed persons believe. It does
> not consist of timeless, detached standards of truth that exist independently

-   What? At first, an empirical descriptive fact, but then prescriptive. Why
-   not just use something like Capability Approach?
    
-   If common morality is historical, why isn't it contingent and arbitrary?
    Relevant since describing the common morality is a useful nonnormative task,
    moving to the normative presumably means the reasons and justifications are
    important---they can't just be contingent and arbitrary.

-   Seems to write off genuine disagreement between sincere commitment to
    morality. (e.g. honor killing) And yet, must have them in order to have
    historical development.

-   Says not relativist (social or similar scope) but is actually this weird
    relativism of a big "universal" scope (anti-realist?)

-   Too thin to be useful.

-   If it's universal to all cultures, how can it be historically embodied?

-   If it was sufficient to just comply with what we all agreed on, then we
    wouldn't be doing this to begin with.

-   This is a bullshit move. Moreover, it is deeply troubling as it suggests
    that the most reasonable assumption to disagreements to sufficiently
    foundational moral issues can be written off to insincere, bad actors. This
    is polarizing and prejudicial.

-   This mea culpa is shit. The issue is with the notion of a common morality
    that has such properties in of itself.

-   Moves the bar but makes the common morality even more thin.

-   Pragmatic, but no discharging moral force. Troubling, suggests we just
    simply cut the Gordian knot and wash our hands of it, rather than
    highlighting a lack of phronesis.

-   Wait, don't we think it's *immoral* to not lie to the Nazi at the door?
    That's not moral norms being overridden by other norms, but a moral
    dilemma (as opposed to practical dilemma in their language).

> W. D. Ross's distinction between _prima facie_ and _actual_ obligations

-   But is it the right conclusion? Does it end there? Is that the goal?

> An agent who determines that a particular act is the best one to perform in a

-   really unhelpful: exploding moralities and dilemmas.

-   Why not virtue ethics and phronesis in that case?
