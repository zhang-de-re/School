=Introduction to Writing and Argumentation=
CHCE Mentoring Session

Thesis Development
- Normative
- Relevant (Connect it to real paper and actual patient care)
- Original
- Proper Scope (Can it be achieved in 25-30 pages)

Types of Evidence
- Empirical evidence
- Testimonial/Expert evidence
  - relying on the authority of a credible expert on the subject matter
- Anecdotal evidence
  - relying on one case of causal observation, usually relying heavily on the
    rhetoric of storytelling
  - use to support premises that aren't quite common knowledge and need a little
    push
- Analogical evidence
  - relying on similarities between phenomena or cases to draw conclusions


Ways to be original
Negative Projects
- The claim has never been challenged before
- Your method of challenging is unique

Positive Projects
- Conclusion is original
- Conclusion is familiar but way of getting there is original
- New connections between familiar concepts/conclusions
- Defend a familiar conclusion against new objections
- New implications for a familiar conclusion

Explain why these matter.
Use the interdisciplinary qualities of the program to make new connections

Proper Scope
Premises should be _strong_ enough to entail the conclusion but _weak_ enough to
be proven in the space and with the evidence that you have.

Use qualifiers strategically

Literature integration
Integrate most _recent_ and most _important_ literature on the topic

Know how you are using a particular reference:
- Is it being used to establish relevance?
- Is it being used to orient your argument?
  - use literature review to show the gaps and carve out the relevance of your
    argument
- Is it supporting the truth of a premise?
- Is it an objection to your argument?

Know how to use the reference for the paper to be efficient in researching

Goals of form
Coherence
Clarity
Concision

Thoughts on process
Good outlines include verbs
- think commit messages
