##### Outline

###### Section 1: Introduction

Thesis: In this paper, I will draw an analogy to the ethics of military service to expler an alternative perspective on the ethcis of medical research foucuse not merely on permissiblity bgut justice. To do so, I offer a framework, contrary to Jonas, of enrolment in medical research as a promissory act. In such an account, the question becomes when is the promise legitimate for both the promiser and the promisee. This lays out the conceptual conditions or when such a promise can be made legitimately including the questions of justice. I conclude with speculation on how analogy to just war theory holds potential for a conceptual framework of just medical research.

###### Section 2: The Permissibility of Medical Research

Topic: The ethical framework surrounding medical research focuses on establishing when is it permissible for people to participate in research.

Transition: If the prblem for the permissibliy of medical research can be reduced down to the problem of when is it permissible for one group of people to sacrifice for some other group's benefit (not even considering porportions), then unless there is some special distintinguishing feature of the nature of medical research, we might usefully consider analogous scenarios with the same moral structure.

- Summary of Jonas (221)
  - brief on Jonas's stakes of human experimentation
      - 1st horn - unethical to conscript for gratutious ends
      - 2nd horn - abandon pretense of informed consent and accept social obligation to be conscripted
  - Jonas's conceptual framework - "Individual versus Society"
    - Deployment of  of social contract and language of rights and obligations (221)
      - holds in tension to institution of consent
      - note: pressuppotition of a claim prior to promissory act
  - The Common Good
    - 1st horn - common good is a paper tight (moral claim)
      - society can afford it
        - except in cases of clear and present danger
      - therefore, unethical to conscript, e.g. even ask to make available (233)
    - 2nd horn - consent is superflous and conscription is sicially obligatory (social claim)
      - presmption society has a right to that good (221)
        - if there is a right, then there must be an obligation (224?, 230)
          - therefore, consent is superfluous
  - Jonas's principle of identification
    - good will argument
      - inference of descending order

- Wertheimer response and reflection
  - two questions: big (distributive justice) and small (participant permissiblity)
  - two reductions (move to S3? necessary?)
    - first, what can we do to people for their own benefit or the benefit of others
    - second, good choice or bad choice
  - The standard view in bioethics (8)
    - sophistication of consent
      - wertheimer fair transaction
      - london integrative approach
  - still fundamentally a question of Permissibility

###### Section 3: Analogy to Military Service

Topic: prior transition
Transition: On the assumption that magnitude and likelihood are the only morally relevant differences, let's consider the permissibility of recruiting soliders or mercenaries to military service.

- Wertheimer's reduction to what can we ask of people for their benefit or the benefit of others
- Jonas's "Sacrificial Theme"
- Methodological question of whether it is fruitful to consider other structurally similar cases
  - research exceptionalism
  - if assertions are moral claims, based on principles, then ought to be consistent
    - unclear some morally relevant distinction
      - otherwise research exceptionalist
- assumption that there are no morally relevant distinctions besides magnitude and likelihood of risk
  - Jonas - ultimately questions of personal dignity and sancrosancity.
    - hard to imagine there are more at stake in a hospital than in a fighting hole on the battlefield

###### Promissory Account: Soldiers and Mercenaries

Topic: Chiara Cordelli offers insight into this question in considering the ethics of privitizing military.

- Cordelli summary
  - Problem: can governments privitize military functions?
  - Thesis: privitization of war consists of a system of morally problematic and possibly invalid promises
    - either mercenary's offer is invalid because entails alienation of certain rights private parties lack the moral power transfer through simple market contracts
    - or, states are under a duty, grounded on their responsibility to protect their own citizens and the stability of their institutions, not to accept the mercenary's offer.

- Cordelli takers her argument to touch on three normative questions (3)
  - what it takes for an agent A to act as the proxy agent for another agent B such that A's actions can *count as* B's own actions
  - what, if anything, makes the occupancy of a public office normatively special
  - whether the risk involved in a job bears on what kind of agent, public or private, can permissibly perform the job
- notably, all three of these questions are also at play in the issue of the participation in clinical research

- Definition of a mercenary (3, citing Fabre)
  - note-working definition due ot lackof philosophical and legal consensus
    - (summarize Cecile Fabre "In Defense of Mercenarism"?)

- Promissory account
  - if contractual exchange of service between a government and a private actor, then mercenarism is a promissory phenomenon
    - definition (4)
  - if mercenarism is a promissory phenomenon, then any moral assessment of such a phenomenon must grapple with the question of whether mercenary contracts contain valid promises
    - definition of valid + binding promises (5)
      - Cordelli choses authority view of promissory obligations but belives compatible with alternatives
        - definition of authority view (5)
          - observe fidelity conditions
    - additionally, alienability condition
      - definition (6)
        - sexual promise example - promiser offers inalienable right
        - be my master example - promiser lakcs the moral power to accept it
          - (include overextension condition?)
      - in either case, no promissory duty obtains

- Alienation problem
  - Analogous to libertarian conceptions of consent, some defend mercenaries on grounds of autonomy
    - Cecile Fabre, In Defense of Mercenarism
  - Cordelli argues promise is invalid despite personal autonomy because mercenaries offer inalienable right
    - definitionally, agreeing to fight a war on behalf of a state involves transfer of discretionary right to life (definition 9)
      - do not have the moral power to alienate discretionary right to life via market exchange
        - namely, fundmental importance for individual autonomy, foreseeable welfare costs of alienating them, the *ex ante* irrationabilty of any such act of alienation (10-11)
    - not merely imposition of risk because of magnitude and likelihood of risk is sufficiently high
  - notes objection that mercenary contracts may simply waive right rather than alienate
    - reply with observation this is reflected in current legal system
      - "mercenaries, unlike soldiers, aer not punished for refusing to sacrifice their lives when needed." (13)
    - this, in turn, generates a new problem: state cannot accept as this come with imposition of sever rishk of harm to others and endangers stability of political institutions
      - if everyone can leave whenever, risks entire enterprise of war
    - therefore, two horns of the dilemma

- Soldiers and social transformation
  - To make sense of this. Cordelli draws on a distinction from Harel and Dorfman beetween actions *for* the state and actions *of* the state
    - fidelity by deference (16)
    - fidelity by reason (16)
    - fidelity by reason sufficient to act in the service of the state, it is not sufficient to act as if state itself is acting through the argumentnot merely motivational capacity but control
  - agents can meet conditions of deferential fidelity to the state if existence of a coherent and unified juridical and administrative-bureacratic institutional structures that
    - proveds an integrated set of procedures through which hat deference requires is determined
    - provides a system of interconnected public offices and hierarchial command and control system which makes possible to regard the acts of occupants of official roles as deferential actions
  - Cordelli contends that soldiers can be aptly regarded as deferential agents
    - essential features of status of soldier is that they operate under and occupy an official role within armed forces authority structure
  - consequently, follows that the duty ot excercise deferential fidelity is also constitutive feature of such status
    - soldiers qualify as proxy agents of the state not mere service providers
      - acquiring status of soldier, and not mere contract, creates normative transformation

- "Importantly, the temporary suspention of the discretionary right to life is justified only to the extent that it can be regarded as a agreement of the role of soldier - a role the demands of which must in turn be justified by appela to those general moral principle that justify the institution of soldiery as a whole" (19)
  - just war
- demands limited by the general moral principle that justify the role in question (20)
  - soldiers retain right to refuse ultimate sacrifice for unjust causes not becaues of a retention to act according to private judgement but because the order falls outside the domain of role and, therefore, invalid

###### Section 5: Promissory Account: Participants and Researchers

Topic: In considering the act of enrolment as both a promissory act and a social transformation, the questoin of the permissibility becomes first one of justice and then that of autonomy and paternalism as balanced in what either party has the moral authority to offer or accept.

- The assertion here is not that the enrolment of research participants is congruent with that of either soldier or mercenary
  - only that the structure of what's morally relevnat is similar enough - as presumably any kind of service that impsoses a burden - that we can draw some insight in the juxtaposition

- first it is worth considering the act of enrolment as a social status transformatoin and its implications
  - why suppose that this must be the case
    - the act of being a research particpant requires that the participant defers decision making to the researchers - they "carry out" the researcher's will
      - thus fideltiy by deference
        - not fidelity by reason
          - "Further insofar as State lacks the means of control, or the appropriate kind of relational connection with the agent for guding Agent's action step-by-step, Agent's actions cannot be regarded as something that State has intentionally brought about"
            - participants are not excercising independent judgement about acions in research.
              - may not even know what own actions are (placebo)
            - agents who are primarily and directly responsible are Researchers
- in supposing that there must be fidelity by deference, we establish a set of conditions that must pertain
  - these conditions are normative on the researchers as a social institution
  - appropriate juridical and administrative-bureacratic structure
    - stipulations an administrative-bureacratic less strenous than soldiers
        - soldiers wield force on state's behalf and are co-authors of that use of force
          - will not dwell on these implications, but will note that they stipulate minimum institutional requirements on what research should have in order to institute legitimate fidelity by deference
            - e.g. IRB, DSMB, FDA, informed consent, etc.
- more significantly, like how the duty of soldier's deferential fidelity is only instantiated by the existence of a status of soldiery that is in turn justified by general moral principles, then duty of participant's deferential fidelity is only instantiated by the existence of research as justified by general moral principles
  - consider the following example that draws on both considerations
  - Wolfendale+Clarke - experimental drug given to soldiers to protect against chemical and biological agent
    - W+C argue permissible by appeal to well-functioning military
      - however, a well-functioning military is not in of itself a moral defense
        - presuming Gulf War was a just war
        - consider alternative: rumors of Russia distributing similar drugs to soldiers in preparation to use chemical and biological weapons to aid in illegal invasion of Ukraine
          - well-funtioning military is not a defenseif the end of a well-functioning military is an unjust war and war crimes
              - both the case Russian soldiers should not dufer to the state in either taking an experimental drug or in excercise of lethal force
                - both are invalid as they are couched in an unjust cause
  - as such, the limits of what researchers can ask participants to do - what they can legitimately ask for deferential fideltiy - are constrained by general principle of justice
    - wertheimer's two levels combined
      - clarification - not issue of fairness or bad choice (commutative justice)
  - outside scope to establish practice of just researche
    - to help sketch out what is in mind, continuing analogy
      - whether or not Just War Theory holds, fruitful set of conditions to ponder in juxtaposition
        - jus ad bellum: just cause, competent authority, right intention, probability of sucess, last resort, porportionality
          - just cause + right intention: self-defense or in defense of another (w/ sufficient evidence)
            - not for material gain or maintaining economy
          - wertheimer qduite 90%-10%; 10%-90%
            - research is just if done to address real need/protect people
            - unjust imposition if done for merely financial gain, especially when not aimed towards potential benefit which address real needs
              - impermissible to participate because unethical in the first place
- in summary, social transformation implies social institutions which in turn are constrained by general moral principle like justice.

- second, if we consider the act of enrolment as a promssory act within just research institutions, framing in terms of promissory acts helps make sense of permissibility
  - not a questoin of social contract, good choice or bad choice, egalitarian principles
  - a question of whether promises can be made validly or not
    - do promiser have the moral authority to offer the right in question
    - do promisees have the moral authority to accept the rights offered
    - do both parties meet the fidelity conditions
- balances individual autonomy and paternalism
- individuals have the authority to exercise their right at their discretion
  - this includes moral authority to choose not to exercise them or to transfer them
    - either case, however, is limited by moral consideration on limits to personal autonomy
      - e.g. exercise of right limited by harm prinicple.
          - moreover, do not have the moral authority to transfer or waive all rights
            - some are inalienable
- in which case, enrolment of participants is not permissible in the case they are required to offer a right they do not have the moral authortiy to offer
  - such a promise would be invalid
    - it is unlikely that the status of research participant grants any additional moral authority
      - limited frm undermining basis of own personal autonomy at the very least
        - additionally, plausibly limited from fowerseeable welfare costs or ex ante irrationallity if the magnitude or likelihood of risk is too high
  - this accunt captures concerns of personal autonomy
    - moral authority emerges in virtue of being autonomous, rational beings
    - additionally, limited by same nature (cannot undermine basis of own autonomy)
      - not constrained in virtue of external factors like good choice or bad choice
  - more significantly, the moral power to offer this promise does not depend on whether the promiser has or is in proximity to the medical condition being studied
    - unclear why a medical condition would give some special moral power
      - assuming fidelity conditions, then, such promises would not be invalid on that consideration alone
        - it cannot be risk, since in most cases rights are waived not transferred
          - participants can, presumalby, exit at any time baring practical limitations - they are compelled
            - this is unlike the mercenaries case because it does not imply researchers cannot accept promise
              - no great risk comparable to censequences of war. only delay or messy data.
- conversely, as a promise must be within the authority of both promiser and promisee, personal autonomy is balanced against paternalist limitations of what researchers have the moral power to accept
  - to put another way, what they do not have the authority to accept and permit
    - limits personal autonomy insofar as there are right ovre which an individual has discretion but someone else cannot
      - "a promise that contains no invalid offer would still be invalid if the promisee lacks the moral power to accept it" (cordelli 7)
        - confer a kind of decisional authority that is qfalitatively problematic which the receiver should reject
          - excessive power over: promisee takes on the role of decider about sensitive issues that, if made by someone else, would seriously compromise the promiser's sense of self or their moral status as a self-determining agent
  - in which case, even if the participant had the moral authority over the rights of the offer, researches cannot validly accept if it represents accepting discretionary pwoer that might seriously compromise the participant's sense of self or their moral tstatus as a self-determining agent
- note that in Jonas's terms this represents a limitation on "conscription"
  - both, ostensibly, are grounded out of respect for the moral status of the participant
    - however, the promissory account gives us explanatory power over mere appeal
      - we can, then, evaluate whether constrains on "conscription" are as tight as Jonas suggests
- It appears there are two main concerns on Jonas regarding enrolment
- (footnote: justice anr felicity constains assumed to handle others)
- one particular concern might be whether researchers have the moral power to accept discretionary right to care
  - in other words, whether a research method like randomization are invalid grouns for a promise because they alienate something like an inalienable right to personalized care
    - supposing that justice conditions pertain, it is unclear that this would be an invalid promise unless fidelity conditions do not pertain
      - first, on the assumption of uncertainty and possiblity (presumed under justice conditions)
        - unclear why personalization transcends our moral authortiy since in such cases personalied care may be personalized but not care
          - within the remit to protect bases of autonomy and welfare to make evident relevant facts regarding care
      - second, on the premise that personalization is some sacred ground of the relationship between clinician and patient
        - theraputic misconception - researchers not doctors
          - implication, promissory misconception - error in identifying promisee
            - if it the case such a promise cannot be made with a doctor, the case would have to be made cannot be made with a researcher as well
              - while some participants may have a misconception - and arguably not making valid promises because they do not meet fidelity conditions
                - another thing to suppse that, when fideltiy conditions are met, participants and researchers lack the moral authority (contra jonas 238) (what the hell does that mean?)
- another concern is whether researchers have the moral authorty to validly accept promises from particpants for research unrelated to their medical condition
  - do researchers have the moral authority to accept an offer to bear the risks and burdens of just research?
    - jfonas gratious progress argument
      - however not relevant for two reasons
        - one, under justice conditions, truly gratutious research not allowed
          - arguably just, then a duty to perform
        - more signficanty, however, is whether researchers have the moral authority to deny felicitious offers merely on condition of medical condition alone if not practically relevant
          - principle of identity and human dignity
            - discretionary right to "good will"
              - unlear, first, why medical condition is a necessary component of indentification or a "good will"
                - not relevant to instatiate fidelity of deferente
                  - assuming fidelity conditions are met, do researchers have discretionary moral authority to discrinate who may be permitted ot exercise good will on the basis of medical condition alone when not otherwise relevant?
                    - contradiction in Jonas (rather, ablism)
                      - not outside moral power of researchers to accept acts of charity and good will service
- contra jonas 242

- with this promissory account of participant enrolment, Jonas' dilemma is resolved
  - bove reason, the moral horn - that research is morally gratutious - is defeased by stipulations of justice and nongratutiousness of permitting virtuous acts
  - additionally, the social horn - that conesent should be waived by the appela to the common good - is also defeased by recognizing the enrolment of a participant is a promise between particpant and researcher and not the social contract
  - it is unclear why we should conceptualize medical research in terms of the social contract just because there is some conception of a common good or public interest
    - under a social contract framework, there is a presumption of a right and corresponding obligation simply in virtuer of being a political memeber
      - if that were the case, then Jonas would be right that informed consent would be superflous to the implicit or explicit consent to political memebership
        - however a recognition of a common good or public interest merely entails a recognition of existing needs
          - does not imply explicit or somehow implicit terms of the social contract
            - moreover, the relevant administrative-bureacratic structures involved in fidelity by deference are often private - outside the social contract
              - there are, therefore, no preexisting rights or obligations to participate in medical research
                - informed consent is indispensible insofar as it is instrumental in demonstrating a valid promissory act and resultant social+moral transformation

###### Section 6: Conclusion

- summary
- caveat: laid out conceptual foundations - how it is operationalized in term of the relevant conditions for the administrative-bureacratic and juridical institutions, demonstrative acts like informed consent, judgement of justce and fidelity conditions, are left for later work
- i don't know make it sound like it works
