	abstract = {The American Philosophical Association’s Committee on Public Philosophy is compiling a list of philosophers who have careers doing public philosophy, either exclusively or concurrently with careers in academic philosophy, and can use your help in identifying them. There are a variety of ways to do public philosophy, so to be more specific, the committee is looking to gather the names of philosophy PhDs (or those substantially along the way towards completing a PhD in philosophy) who meet any one of the following four criteria: do not work in academia but whose work often involves doing philosophy with or for the public, or promoting philosophy to the public. have written two or more philosophy essays aimed at non-philosophers which were published in popular non-philosophy periodicals or venues (e.g., websites). have written at least one philosophy book (or a book with a substantial amount of philosophy in it) largely for a non-philosophically trained audience. are regularly involved in activities that bring philosophy to the public, including broad promotional activities (e.g., festivals), websites and shows that aim to bring philosophy to a non-philosophical audience, and outreach programs for traditionally philosophically-underserved populations (such as prisoners, the elderly, pre-college students, and the lay community more generally). Please list people you know of who match any of these descriptions–including yourself. Also include in your comment, if you don’t mind, a description of the work or a link to a description of it. Thank you. (At some point in the future, the list may be expanded to include philosophers who do not have graduate degrees, but for now, please limit your suggestions to those who do, or who soon will.)

	abstract = {Philosophers have a long history of being misunderstood by others. The risk of dangerous misunderstandings have led some philosophers in previous eras to take a variety of strategies—careful phrasings, flattery, literary devices, understatement, pseudonyms, running away—to avoid getting in trouble with the masses or their rulers. Concern with not being understood is still with us. That many people are largely unfamiliar with what philosophy is, what philosophers do, and why it might be valuable are common complaints among today’s philosophers. Nowadays, philosophers and their work are more publicly accessible than ever before in the history of humanity, thanks to the development and spread of communications technology and increases in literacy. What counters this heightened potential for public disapprobation is a mix of factors, including how boring or useless the public finds philosophical work, how forbidding the writing style of much philosophy is to those not trained in it, and the easy and instant access people have to an astounding abundance of competitors for their attention. Most philosophy is simply unnoticed by the public. But sometimes philosophy is noticed, and sometimes this is because it is meant to be noticed, because it’s an instance of what has come to be called “public philosophy,” a category that includes a range of activities by philosophers (mainly academics or people with at least some advanced academic training in philosophy) specifically aimed at bringing philosophy to, or doing philosophy with, non-philosophers outside the university setting. While there has been a fair amount of discussion of the variety of forms public philosophy might take, the goods and bads of public philosophy, what public philosophy should be like, and so on, something relevant to public philosophy that I don’t believe I’ve seen explicitly addressed is just how bizarre philosophers might seem to others when they’re engaging with one another. I think we should talk about this. One thing about philosophers is that they are capable of finding philosophy very enjoyable. In any activity, a particularly skillful or surprising move might elicit delight, an unusual strategy might be fun to try out, a vigorous volley between the participants might be exhilarating, and you might need to know a fair amount about the activity to understand what’s causing the..},

	abstract = {Nussbaum’s politics of wonder focuses on non-human animals. However, the sense of wonder within it also applies to human beings. Can wonder in Nussbaum’s sense be helpful when articulating justice between people on politically liberal grounds? I argue that it can because it helps us consider our specific form of striving, that is, human freedom, in comparison and contrast with other kinds of living striving. Thereby it keeps in view striving as such. To make my case, I show how wonder in Nussbaum’s sense is helpful for Rawls’s core legitimation scenes of democratic fairness, the original position, and public reasoning. Furthermore, wonder is not objectionable in these scenes, since it brings into view the considerability of life, such that life should not be used without a good enough reason, on the basis of which any socialized conception of how to live well ought to proceed. Thus an environmental sensibility has a useful place within mainstream liberal justice.},
