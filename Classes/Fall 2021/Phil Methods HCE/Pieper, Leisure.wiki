Of course, the original meaning of the concept of "leisure" has practically been
forgotten in today's leisure-less culture of "total work": in order to win our
way to a real understanding of leisure, we must confront the contradiction that
rises from our overemphasis on the world of work. "One does not only work in
order to live, but one lives for the sake of one's work," this statement, quoted
by Max Weber, makes immediate sense to us, and appeals to current opinion. It is
difficult for us to see how in fact it turns the order of things upside down.

- Max Weber, _The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism_

pp.4
"We work in order to be at leisure." Would we hesitate to say that here there
world is really turned upside-down? Doesn't this statement appear almost
_immoral_ to the man or woman of the world of "total work"? Is it not an attack
on the basic principles of human society?

- Aristotle, _Nichomachean Ethics_ X, 7 (1177b 4-6)
- Aristotle, _Politics_ (stating that the "pivot" around which everything turns
  is leisure) VIII 3 (1337b3)

The real reason for mentioning it was to show how sharply the modern valuation
of work and leisure differs from that of Antiquity and the Middle Ages.

pp. 6
Now, the very fact of this difference, of our inability to recover the original
meanings of "leisure," will strike us all the more when we realize how
extensively the opposing idea of "work" has invaded and taken over the whole
realm of human action and of human existence as a whole; when we realize, as
well, how ready we are to grant all claims made for the person who "works".

pp. 6
"Worker" will be used in an anthropological sense: as a general human ideal. It
is with this meaning in mind that Ernst Niekisch spoke of the "worker" as an
"imperial figure" and Ernst Jünger sketched a portrait of that "worker"-type
which has already begun to determine the future of humanity.

- Ernst Niekisch, Die dritte imperiale Figur (Berlin, 1935)
- Ernst Jünger, Der Arbeiter. Herrschaft und Gestalt (Hamburg, 1932)

pp. 7
An altered conception of the human being _as such_, and a new interpretation of
the meaning of the human existence _as such_, looms behind the new claims being
made for "work" and the "worker".

pp. 7
If something of real import is going to be said on the matter, it will be
achieved not by reconstructing a historical narrative, but by digging more
deeply to the very roots of a philosophical and theological understanding of a
human person.
