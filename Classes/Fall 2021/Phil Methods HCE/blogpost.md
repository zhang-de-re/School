###### Equipoise or Evidentialism: Ethics of Uncertainty in RCTs
###### Alexander Zhang

The response to the West African Ebola virus epidemic is hailed by some as a
triumph of modern science and international cooperation.
It is a success story of international
collaboration as organizations spanning national governments (e.g. Canada, the
United states, and impacted African countries); government agencies (e.g. PHAC,
NIH, and CDC); non-governmental organizations (e.g. Medicins San Frontieres);
global public health entities (e.g. WHO, GAVI, and the Wellcome trust);
universities (e.g. University of Geneva and Dalhousie University); and private
sector companies (such as NewLink Genetics, GSK, and Merck) resulted in the
rapid distribution of a vaccine widely reported to give 100 percent protection.
Surely this represents a shining achievement of humankind coming together
to accomplish good works.

Perhaps.

It is also worth noting that Merck's rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine was still experimental
and distributed under Phase II trials for efficacy.
This was not without moral controversy.
The trial design for the vaccine candidate field was contentious.
Some advocated for the tried-and-true randomized placebo controlled trial as the
most rapid and statistically sound way to determine whether the vaccine works.
Others protested that a controlled trial was not 
acceptable.
Given the risks were so high, it was argued that giving participants anything 
other than the experimental vaccine would be inhumane.
The compromise was a step-wedged design where a delay in vaccination for some
was used as a "control": less statistically sound but all participants would be
given the vaccine eventually.
It is worth noting that in one trial, on the strength of interim results, the
trial design was changed to give all participants the vaccine immediately.
It is also worth noting that the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine was only approved in 2019
after the support of additional trials in the Democratic Republic of Congo
outbreak of 2018-2020.

It is difficult to say, broadly speaking, that this effort was not a success.
However, given the controversy of the trial design and later criticism of the
validity of the study results, its worth revisiting the ethical dilemma.
When is it ever ethically permitted to not give those whose health is at risk a 
medical intervention?
This is a troubling issue for medical research given that the randomized control 
trial is the gold standard for the demonstration of efficacy and safety
necessary for regulatory approval and licensing.
After all, a control entails that,
if one course of treatment was better than the alternatives, some portion of the
participants were not given the best intervention available.
What should we make of the competing considerations between the duty to care for 
the sick and the scientific process involved in creating new and better 
treatments?

One established response is the principle of clinical equipoise which provides
the moral framework upon which randomized clinical trials are deemed to be
permissible or not.
Roughly put, clinical equipoise attempts to resolve these concerns by
stipulating that trials must be conducted from a certain epistemic state where
the options evaluated are of equal weight.
If it is wrong to hold a trial where you intentionally withhold the best
treatment, then researches in a sate of equipoise are absolved since, in giving
all options equal weightiness, it cannot be intentional because they do not
know.

There are some common objections to the concept of clinical equipoise.
One is that it goes counter to the fiduciary responsibility of the clinician to
exercise their judgment in serving the patient's best interests.
After all, randomization results in the treatment decision being taken out of
the hands of the clinician and being left to randomization.
Another objection argues equipoise is unfeasible since it depends upon a 
psychologically dubious tightrope to walk.

-especially
given this state of balance must appartenly be maintained even as interim
results come in.
In response, it has been suggested that equipoise instead be defined by the
consensus, or lack therof, of the medical community at large.
In this way it is moved from the unstable subjective psychological state of the
researcher to a more stable socially-constructed one of disagreement.

To my mind, however, neither the notion of clincial equipoise nor the objections
to it are satistfying.
I believe there is a moral framework under which some RCTs are permissable and ,
moreover, tha we have a suty to conduct them because of the care and fiduciary
obligations of the clinician-patient relationship.
Such a principle emerges out of the epistemology of the problem.
The relevant ueathure is the objective uncertainty rearding efficacy and safety
of which a tate of equipoise is not necessary.
We can see this in the Ebola vaccine trials where the involved parties believed
it to be efficacious befor eth necessary empirical rpocess to know that is the
case was completed.
If we attend to the distinction between the doxastic attitued of belief and
knowledge, then it becomes clear that clinical equipoise is epistemollogically
misguided.

What is morally relevant isn't our confidence but tha we do not know or have
some justfied belief sufficiently close to knowledge.
In this state of uncertiainty where ther are such hight stakes associated with
what we assert to "know", we ought to be evidentialist.
For one thinkg, as William Clifford observes, the sincerity of our belief and
the actual outcomes are not morally relevant if we have put people in peril
because we have not done our due epistemic dilligence.
As he argues "The question of right or wrong has to do with the origin of his
beliefs, not the matter of it; not what it was, but how he got it; not whether
it turned out to be true or false, but whether he had a right to believe on such
evidence as was before him."
That is to say, that we have a moral, no just an intellectual, duty of inquiry
beyond our prior sincere and comfortable convictions.
What it is toknow is distant from what it is to merely believe.
Classically, knowledge is defined in terms of justified true belief:
something over and above simply a belief where we are just subjectively
confident in some proposition.
The problem with equipoise becomes clear.
The fact of uncertainty, that we do not have knowledge, is dependent on the lack
of justification, not the subjective feelting that we "know".
I don't mean just the risk of life and deathe surrounding unknowns in
healthcare, although tthat too, but the very foundations of the relationship of
care between clinician and patient.

A the  root of a caring relationship there must be trust.
Again, many of the criticisms levied against clinical equipoise argue that RCTs
undermine the fiduciary objections clinicians have to patients.
But what is it to trust?
Again, Clifford presents a relevant point.
Trust, particularly in the authortiy of thosse asserting to know, is not just a
question of the moral character or good will of a person.
THere is also the epistemic question of whether they can know what they claim to
know or are simply expressiong their sincere belief in what they think they
know.
Without good reason that clinicians are not just excercising their judgement in
the best interests of the patient but also that their judgment is grounded on
knowledge.
However, if that knowledge in fact depends ont he empirical evidence obtained
from RCTs, then curtailing those mechanism  the necessary epishic factor in
for trust between the clinicain and the patient to exist.
As such, we have a duty to inquire in part because it is neccesary for turst,
and therefore care
As such, we haev a moral as well as an intellectual duty to inquire when we
tface objective unceratinty.
We ought to be evidentialists.
