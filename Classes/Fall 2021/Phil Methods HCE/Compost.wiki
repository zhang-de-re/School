Overwork/burnout

996 culture. Multiple jobs. Loans, childcare. Work insecurity. Voluntary
overwork. Closed possibility space.
Lack of self-awareness but easily recognized

Responsibility/culpability? Working day, employers, public health, social
welfare to obviate issue (come at problem from both ends) 

Moral grounding? Well-being, capability (leisure) voluntary overwork contra to
principalist value of autonomy? But how to avoid objectionable paternalism?
