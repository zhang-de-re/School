Determinants of antibody persistance...

pp. 1
The recombinant vesicular stomatis virus (rVSV) vaccine expressing the Zaire
Ebola virus (ZEBOV) glycoprotein is efficacious in the weeks following
single-dose injection, but duration of immunity is unknown.

pp. 1
Antibody responses to single-dose rVSV-ZEBOV vaccination are sustained across
dose ranges and settings, a key criterion in countries wehre booster
vaccinations would be impractical.

pp. 2
Despite the effectiveness of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine in the field, trends of
vaccine-induced proteciton against Ebola virus disease remain undefined. The
WHO-sponsored Guinea ring vaccination trial documenting field efficacy did not
harvest blood for immunogenecity analyses, and the mechanisms conferring
protection in non-human primate models have not been confirmed to be the same in
man.

All Geneva volunteers provided written informed consent before enrolment in this
follow-up observational study. The Kilifi and Lambarene volunteers had given
written informed consent to be included in their respective original trials.
