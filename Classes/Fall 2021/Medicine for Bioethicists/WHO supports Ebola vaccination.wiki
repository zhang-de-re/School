"We need to act fast to stop the spread of Ebola by protecting people at risk of
being infected with the Ebola virus, identifying and ending all transmission
chains and ensuring that all patients have rapid access to safe, high-quality
care," said Dr. Peter Salama, WHO Deputy Director-General for Emergency
Preparedness and Response

While the vaccine is awaiting review by relevant regulatory authories, WHO's
Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) has recommended the
use of the rVSV-ZEBOV Ebola vaccine under an expanded access/compassionate use
protocol during Ebola outbreaks linked to the Zaire strain such as the one
ongoing in the DRC.
