= Tech Ethics =

pieces of technology: product of techne, tecno logic. tools shaping us, not just
us putting intentions into tools

metaphysical dimension: what is this tool
epistemological dimension: how does it shape what i know

we create machines to have their own automaticity, and insofar as that, they
have their own intentions in a limited sense - we build into that - but as they
become more sophisticated, they make more decisions for us.

stiegler what makes life worth living

history of philosophy per bishop
to know is to know causes
our questions originate from what we know towards what we don't know and try to
parse what we don't know in terms that we already know
basic question, ultimately metaphysical questions
who - formal cause, eidos, ideas form
what - material
how - efficient cause
why -  final causes, purposes
where - space
when - time

in ancient philosophy, each of basic questions integral to every thing
over time, stopped thinking in these terms where all are operative are in the
being of things
starting with francis bacon
final causes removed from knowledge
hume
cannot know forms, eidos
left with the what and can move from what to how and infer formal cause and
mathematically infer where when
kant
how can we know anything if we don't have empirical access to things
transcendental idealism
tries to get us to some kind of scientific knowledge - can't have noumena can
have understanding of how we have concepts
deontology/intention
alleges our ethics of technology is deontological/about intention
intention balanced what and how from the isolated individual communing with the
good
hegel
immanitizes the transcendental field, saving from platoism by being aristotelian
ideas have to be materialized
take the unconcious in the material (law) and change it into thought (spirit)
and build it back into reality

kapp is hegelian
hieromorphic (?)
