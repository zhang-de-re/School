Haber-Bosch process: technological substitution
iPhone tech stems from government projects
  The Entrepreneurial State, Mariana Mazzucato
    possibly hard line, strong criticism from libertarians (no surprise) but
    point for me in tech determinism is just that government has _a_ role to
    play in direction of innovation, not that it is the sole engine or that
    private sector is minimal.
      criticisms: narrow view of innovation, misrepresenting the returns of
      innovation, questionable policy recommendations

have to do marx technological determination paper. argue for the need of
constructive philosophy to help guide the trajectory towards a better
post-capitalist future instead of a disasterous barbarism
  adorno and pratical reinterpretation of the charge to imagine to world better
  if you just deconstruct everything, you are left with nothing.
  it may be that the literary approach of contientalism is conducive to the
  imaginative, speculative project. but it the charge is to communicate with the
  world, it is hopelessly obscured

technology and hope? orienting towards hope

establish the measure of progress as well-being via capability approach
  - not "techno-logic" standing reserves
  - not committed to pushing preconceived conceptions of well-being
  - is relevant to any project given any way in which we might imagine how to
    orient to technology instantiates some material conditions
  - king knut: tech is the tide (or put at end?)
trajectories
  - need to be involved given risk of bad trajectories
  - not _fighting against_
  - tech increases capability, but does it also increase alienation
  - hope resides since tech possesses potential for epochal change
Marx technological determination
need for participation is not just development but deployment of tech
  ultimately the ethics of technology must address needs (as found in capability
  approach)
    on all levels - the practical utilitarian (?) to the imaginative turn
    towards the future.
