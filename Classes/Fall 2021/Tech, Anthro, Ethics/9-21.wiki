== Tech Ethics Lecture 9/21 ==

Stiegler, linked to Heidegger
  Heidegger immanentized time into history and death
    goes further and "materialize" time (technics not concept of time)
      technics sets the horizon for being and humankind
      materialize of of technology, sets pulse of time
  human agency relativized by technics
    invention  invested into machines
      tendencies open space of imagining
        they increasingly become more like intentionality
          tech leads social world
