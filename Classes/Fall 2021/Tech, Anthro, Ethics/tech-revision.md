Dear Jeff,

I have taken into consideration the reviews of my original draft.
Bishop's review raised the significant concern that the exegesis of Stiegler was
not sufficiently fleshed out to ground the methodological argument.
Moreover, that the criticism was not sufficiently explicit beyond presenting a
nice hermeneutical lens.
To that end, and with the permission that it was okay to submit a longer paper, I
provided a more detailed exegesis of Stiegler both explicating his framework and
noting areas where he performs an ideal theory methodology.
In the course of this, I realized the incongruence between the examples Stiegler
gives and the framework he provides.
As a result, I elected to both retain and elaborate on the pill example and expand it with G.A.
Cohen's technological determinism to draw out the incongruence between
technological and social causes of disruption at the heart of the incongruence.
This distinction is further elaborated with the addition of a final section that
deals with objections and the recommended addition of the argument from the
Chinese room.
Reviewer 1's comments were helpful in noting that the exegesis on Mills's
framework on ideal vs nonideal theory needed to be more explicit.
As a result, I further elaborated that section with examples that flesh out the
methodological argument and what constitutes the conditions for a nonideal
methodology.
Further, in response to their confusion regarding the pill, I made more explicit
the tie back from Haslanger to Fricker to the technology and the relevant
interaction between technology and social epistemology.
Reviewer 2's comments also noted confusion on the ideal/nonideal framework
questioning whether the argument is against idealization itself.
I clarify both in the Mills exegesis and the presentation of the pill and Cohen
that the nonideal idealizes as all models do.
Moreover, I make more explicit the two arguments against ideal theory to make
clear the insufficiency of the comments to the effect that ideal theorists do
not hold that their theory is alone sufficient given the historical failure to
ever move beyond.
From all three reviewers, there was a questioning about whether the presented
model contradicted Stiegler's and what work it was supposed to do.
As a result, I respond to these objections by making more explicit the argument
in the last section.
I take these objections to be in fact concessions: if we respond by accepting
the model I present, then that implies that Stiegler's ideal methodology fell
short and a nonideal methodology was necessary to fill in the gaps.
This, however, is the argument I am trying to make.
Finally, despite reviewers suggestion that the care argument be more
substantial, it was decided to be dropped for a couple reasons.
One, the paper is already long enough.
Two, it is unnecessary and distracts from the core methodological thesis.
Finally, comments that misunderstood the intention were addressed by more
explicit qualification and scoping out.

I appreciate the reviewers comments and thank them for their time.
