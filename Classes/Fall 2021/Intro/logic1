All the perceptions of the human mind resolve themselves into two distinct
kinds, which I shall call "impressions" and "ideas". The difference between
these consists in the degrees of force and liveliness with which they strike

perceptions which enter with most force and violence, we may name "impressions";
and under this name I comprehend all our sensations, passions, and emotions, as
they make their first appearance in the soul. By "ideas" I mean the faint images
of these in thinking and reasoning.
