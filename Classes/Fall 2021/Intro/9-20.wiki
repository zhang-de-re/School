moral absolutism vs relativism -> scaffolding into Euthyphro

in-class exercise:

case 1: ice cream   case 2: time travel astronomer (heliocentric) case 3: aliens

            case 1    case 2    case 3
real
disagreement n        y         y

fact?       n         y         y

known?/
proven?     n         y         n

Started class by asking two students what the best ice cream was. Then had them
think-pair-share on three questions: real disagreement? Fact of the matter
(world)? And known/proven? Then went on to do the same for two other cases: time
traveling astronomer or heliocentrism and E.T. intelligence today.
  Ragland trying to lead them into recognizing that we can be committed to facts
  without knowing what the facts are (as well as the relativism stuff)
  
world vs mind
fact vs appearance
truth value vs knowledge or proof

moral absolutism (realism, objectivism)

there is some (at least one) _mind-independent_ _action-guiding_ moral principle
  it can be general + applied differently in different situations

Moral Relativism (Subjectivism)
  different scopes
    - individual---my beliefs create what's right/wrong for me
    - cultural---cultural consensus creates moral standards for that culture
    - (divine command theory)
  beliefs creating moral reality
  _all_ moral facts are socially constructed
